		<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		&nbsp; I can still remember my childhood as happy and as nostalgic as it 
		is.<sup>1</sup> It was the best time of my life where I only had to 
		worry about playing and having more friends.<sup>2</sup> Well before, 
		making friends was much easier.<sup>3</sup> I remember how I used 
		to be friends with most of the other kids from my neighborhood and 
		we would play outside until sunset.<sup>4</sup> My life before 
		during school year is only divided into school life and after school
		life.<sup>5</sup> Wherein, after school is where I would go outside
		even though the sun is still high.<sup>6</sup> I didn’t worry about 
		getting tanned nor getting dirty from too much playing in the field 
		as long as I spend my time with my friends.<sup>7</sup> But, the best
		part is yet to come.<sup>8</sup> And, it is summer where we get to 
		spend our vacation at my mother’s family house in their province for
		almost two months.<sup>9</sup> My cousins who are close to our age 
		became our closest companions before during our entire childhood.
		<sup>10</sup> Ever since babies we’ve been introduced by our parents.
		<sup>11</sup> Oh! how much memories we have created together, from 
		wearing diapers to playing in the plaza.<sup>12</sup> What makes it 
		more happier is that their house is only one walk away from the street.
		<sup>13</sup> Everything that a child could wish of is already there.
		<sup>14</sup> Both of our family houses have gardens where we can play
		with our cousins and aside from that, my mother’s old family house 
		became like a farm.<sup>15</sup> My tito had chickens and crops of 
		different kinds.<sup>16</sup> He also had different kinds of birds 
		before like lovebirds, java birds and martinez.<sup>17</sup> And, my
		grandmother had a garden of different plants.<sup>18</sup> How fun it
		was to chase the chickens before and to also feed them and watch them
		grow.<sup>19</sup> Then, in the afternoon we would go to the plaza 
		which is only walking distance to buy our favorite meryenda, Empanada,
		Ilocos’ specialty.<sup>20</sup> And, we would go to the Sta.Maria 
		Church near the plaza because we would race climbing it up which 
		has more than a hundred stairs.<sup>21</sup> It's considered a 
		tourist spot of our municipality and is inscribed as a UNESCO 
		World Heritage Site.<sup>22</sup></p></blockquote>

		<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		&nbsp; As for my teenage years and high school life, it was more focused
		on studies where I managed to continuously excel academically.<sup>1
		</sup> But, also the stage of my life where we had to say goodbye to my
		childhood friends from the neighborhood.<sup>2</sup> It is because we 
		moved into a new home and thus a new school.<sup>3</sup> I did have 
		friends from the school except for the neighborhood.<sup>4</sup> The 
		new apartment was full of adult and younger kids.<sup>5</sup> We didn’t
		have neighbors who are close to our age.<sup>6</sup> But, we still have
		our childhood cousins.<sup>7</sup> Even in our high school time, we 
		would still spend out two months vacation in my mother’s family house.
		<sup>8</sup> It became like a tradition.<sup>9</sup> It is also in my 
		teenage years where my friends from my school became also my friends 
		after school.<sup>10</sup> It was a new chapter in my life.<sup>11
		</sup> New experiences, new environment, new changes and many more.
		<sup>12</sup> It was the time wherein most of us have crushes and have
		interest and curiosity in relationships.<sup>13</sup> It was also the 
		time in cultivating talents and skills.<sup>14</sup> And, choosing the 
		course and university you would like to go to.<sup>15</sup> Of course,
		mostly would want to be on the top universities which is why almost 
		everyone are preparing for the entrance exams and fulfilling their 
		university's requirements.<sup>16</sup> It is the time of choosing 
		whether to follow what you want or what your parents want.<sup>17</sup> 
		As for me, I chose what my parents wanted.<sup>18</sup> And, so I 
		prepared for the entrance exam of the universities’ they preferred, 
		which are state universities.<sup>19</sup> However, I only passed in
		one school where their preference of course is not available.<sup>20
		</sup> And so, we were left with private universities.<sup>21</sup>

		<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		&nbsp; Starting my college years was tiring.<sup>1</sup> A new chapter
		in my life again where everything became much more serious.<sup>2</sup> 
		My mother wanted me to pursue nursing and so I tried it.<sup>3</sup> 
		It was tiring to be in a top medical university as they would really 
		push you to your limits.<sup>4</sup> It was a never ending study of 
		thick books with small writings.<sup>5</sup> I remember how our 
		professor used to say that in their university, it is a sin to sleep 
		for more than 4 hours.<sup>6</sup> And, he was right.<sup>7</sup> 
		Though, those sleepless nights and breakdown from memorizing thick 
		books paid off when I was able to be a dean’s lister, but never have I
		ever thought that I would be able to make it.<sup>8</sup> However, my 
		life in nursing didn’t last long because my parents can no longer afford
		the tuition fees during the second semester.<sup>9</sup> And, so I 
		stopped for almost half a year.<sup>10</sup> During that time, I 
		decided to shift course and change school which brings me here to UE.
		<sup>11</sup> The college life in Manila was very different from my 
		previous experience.<sup>12</sup> Moreover, I became an irregular 
		student because my minor subjects were credited.<sup>13</sup> I’m still
		holding on to this course for a better future.<sup>14</sup> I believe 
		that it will be rewarded soon.<sup>15</sup> College years taught me that
		life is not a race.<sup>16</sup> And, I should not be defined by my 
		grades but on how much I learned.<sup>17</sup> It was the biggest change
		in my life as I’m no longer putting my value as a person in my class 
		standing but rather by my experiences in life and how I value myself.
		<sup>18</sup> In this chapter of my life, I wanted to focus on myself 
		and to improve it physically, mentally and emotionally.<sup>19</sup> 
		It may be tiring but I accept what life has to offer — may it be good 
		or bad.<sup>20</sup> I’ll just take the negative as a lesson.<sup>21
